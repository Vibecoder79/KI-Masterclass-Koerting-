# Ideation

Systematically research new ideas, cross-check against architecture + backlog + learnings, and turn them into a high-quality user story.

## Workflow (9 steps)

### Step 0: Load environment

1. Read `.claude/environment.json` (if present — otherwise fall back to defaults and log a warning).
2. Extract paths from `paths.*` as needed (e.g. `paths.reports_local`, `paths.lessons_l1`, `paths.lessons_l2_dir`, `paths.lessons_l3`, `paths.specs`, `paths.architecture_design`).
3. Before any tool invocation, check `tools_available.<tool>`. If `false` or missing, the skill skips the call and notes it in the output.
4. Missing-file fallback: assume the schema defaults (`journal/`, `journal/reports/local/`, `specs/`, `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md`) and add a note to the output: "Note: `.claude/environment.json` is missing — defaults active. Recommendation: re-run `/bootstrap` or create the file manually."

### Step 0a: Check architecture-doc freshness (pre-flight, soft)

> **Activation:** this step always runs when `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` exists in the project root. If the file is missing: skip without warning (project not yet far enough along).

**Goal:** warn before stories are written against a potentially stale architecture doc. **Not a hard gate** — the operator can always say "yes" and continue.

1. Read the last modification timestamp of `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md`:
   ```bash
   git log -1 --format=%cd --date=iso ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md
   ```
   For non-versioned files (no git log): fall back to `stat`.
2. Read the threshold from `.claude/environment.json`: `thresholds.architecture_doc_freshness_days` (default `30` if the field or file is missing).
3. Compute the age in days (today minus last-changed date).
4. If age `>` threshold:
   ```
   Warning: ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md has not been updated in X days
   (threshold: Y days).

   Recommendation: run /architecture-review before writing new stories
   against a possibly stale architecture.

   Continue anyway? [yes/no]
   ```
5. On `no`: the skill stops with the note "Operator decision: run /architecture-review first". No issue is created.
6. On `yes`: continue to step 0.5/0.6/1. The decision is recorded in the story under `Current State` (`Architecture doc Z days old — operator override`).

**Why soft, not hard-block?** A hard gate would block `/ideation` on every project that hasn't been touched in a while. In practice the doc is often "old enough to warn about, but still valid" — the operator decides per story. The threshold is configurable: a fast-evolving system sets 14 days, a stable system 90 days.

### Step 0.5: Learnings context (if learning loop active)

> **Activation:** this step only runs if `{PROJECT_PATH}/.learning-loop` exists (contents: `L1`, `L2` or `L3`).

Before creating the story, read the most recent lessons-learned and cross-check them against the idea.

**L1:** read the last 3 entries in `journal/learnings.md`.

**L2/L3:** read the last 2–3 sprint retros:
- `journal/sprint-{YYYY-MM-XX}.md` sorted by date
- Extract frontmatter tags `what_didnt`

**Matching:** if a `what_didnt` tag (or its content) thematically matches the current story idea:

```
Warning: in the last retro, X was marked as "didn't work" (root cause: Y).
Does this affect this story?

Possible options:
  a) Adjust the story to avoid X
  b) Current problem is different — continue
  c) Drop the story (the pattern isn't viable)
```

Operator decides. The answer is documented in the story under `Current State` as a context hint.

**No match:** step 0.5 is mentioned in the story as *"Learnings check: no anti-pattern match"* and we continue to step 1.

### Step 0.6: Intent check (if Intent active)

> **Activation:** this step only runs if the `{PROJECT_PATH}/intents/` directory exists and contains at least one `INTENT-XX.md` file.

1. Load the active `intents/INTENT-XX.md` (newest file by date, or via `status: aktiv` in the frontmatter)
2. Cross-check the story idea against the intent metrics and intent statement
3. Assign a classification:

| Label | Criterion | Consequence |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **on-intent** | Story pays directly into an intent metric | Story is created |
| **neutral** | Story is indirectly required (infrastructure, tech debt, enabler) | Story is created WITH mandatory rationale in the story body |
| **off-intent** | Story doesn't pay in at all or contradicts the intent | Story is NOT created — `/ideation` returns a rationale |

4. Add label + rationale to the story body as a `## Intent Check` section.

On `off-intent`: inform the operator + propose how the story could be adjusted to reach `neutral` or `on-intent`. The operator can force an override with an explicit "override intent".

Binary on/off would be too harsh — infrastructure (auth refactor, DB migration) is never directly on-intent but must still be possible (→ `neutral` with rationale).

### Step 1: Research (if needed)

Check whether external research is needed (new APIs, unfamiliar technologies, best practices).
- If yes: use the `/research` skill approach (2-tier: QUICK for facts, DEEP for analysis).
  Perplexity API details: see `research/references/perplexity-api.en.md`
- If no (internal refactor, known technology): skip

### Step 2: Load context

Run in parallel:
1. `linear.getOpenIssues()` — load the whole backlog
2. **Read `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` IN FULL** — to the last line — all sections §1–§8 and all ADRs.
   **Mandatory checklist — all the following sections must be read:**
   - [ ] §1 Architectural Vision + guiding principles
   - [ ] §2 Quality Attributes (availability, latency, security targets)
   - [ ] §3 All existing ADRs in full (ADR-1 through the last one in the doc)
   - [ ] §4 Layer-to-pipeline mapping
   - [ ] §5 Failure mode analysis
   - [ ] §6 Component relationships
   - [ ] §7 Scalability roadmap
   - [ ] §8 Testing architecture
   - [ ] References section (cross-refs to other architecture docs)
3. Read `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` IN FULL — component list, data flows, known weak spots
4. Check relevant sections of `lib/config.js`
5. Check: does a similar issue already exist? Does the feature partially exist?

**DB schema check (mandatory if the story touches a persistent data source — only if the project has a DB / schema registry):**

1. Read the current schema (project-specific DB module, e.g. `lib/db.js` with a `SCHEMA_VERSION` constant)
2. Scan all open issues for a `## DB Schema Impact` section — which versions are already "taken"?
3. Determine the next free target version (conflict = two stories with the same `targetSchemaVersion`)
4. Fill `## DB Schema Impact` in the story spec: `currentSchemaVersion` + `targetSchemaVersion` + new tables/columns
5. On version conflict: record the order in `## Dependencies` ("must be implemented after [STORY-XXX]")

If the project has no versioned DB-schema management: skip this step.

**Domain context (if present):** if `docs/domain/` exists in the project, read all `docs/domain/*.md` files. Extract key terms and regulatory requirements. Link relevant domain terms in the story's acceptance criteria (example: "Payment processing via [[docs/domain/chargeback.md]]"). If `docs/domain/` is missing: skip this step.

> **Why read ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md in full?** It's the only document that consolidates all
> architecture decisions (ADRs), quality attributes and strategic constraints. Without having
> read all ADRs you lack the 360° view: the kill-switch pattern is mandatory for every feature,
> ADRs influence signal-routing decisions. Every new story must be checked against ALL ADRs —
> otherwise you build features that collide with existing decisions.

### Step 3: Architecture Design Document (for features)

For feature stories and complex changes, create an ADD:
See [references/architecture-design-document.en.md](references/architecture-design-document.en.md)

The ADD describes:
- Affected layers and component interplay
- Data architecture: flow, formats, consistency
- API and integration design
- Infrastructure impact (from the Cloud System Engineer, if available as a teammate)
- 8-dimensions assessment with findings and concrete action
- Architecture decisions (ADRs) with rationale
- Risks and mitigations
- Implementation notes (affected files, order, config)

**Scope scales with complexity** — the ADD template defines which sections are
mandatory per story type. Bug fixes don't need an ADD.

**With agent teams:** architect teammate and cloud system engineer co-author the
ADD and challenge each other.

### Enforcement check (mandatory for every new ADR or architecture decision)

After every new ADR or architecture decision ALWAYS ask:

> **"Is this decision only documented — or also machine-enforced?"**

| Answer | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Machine-enforced** (commit hook, self-healing check, config validation) | Note in story description where the guard lives |
| **Only documented** | Automatically propose a guard story |

**Typical guard mechanisms:**
- Commit hook in `.claude/hooks/` (like spec-gate, exchange-guard)
- Self-healing check (architecture guard) — extension with a new check
- Config validation in self-healing

**Important:** the operator doesn't need to ask — this check runs automatically
as part of every ideation session. If an ADR exists only on paper → propose a guard
story directly in step 5 (alignment) as a separate 1-SP story.

### Step 4: Draft the story

Combine the ADD + story template. The draft consists of:

**Story body** (by type):
- **Feature/agent:** see [references/story-template-feature.en.md](references/story-template-feature.en.md)
- **Fix/refactor:** see [references/story-template-fix.en.md](references/story-template-fix.en.md)

**ADD as attachment** (for features):
- The ADD gets attached as a comment on the Linear story
- Or as a collapsed section (`<details>`) in the story body

The 4 perspectives feed into story + ADD:
- **Business:** section 1 in the ADD (summary)
- **Architecture:** sections 2–7 in the ADD
- **Implementation:** section 9 in the ADD + story template
- **Quality:** acceptance criteria in the story + section 8 in the ADD

### Step 5: Alignment + classification + sprint-fit

Present the draft to the operator, together with:
- Dependencies to existing issues (bidirectional)
- Priority recommendation in the overall context
- Affected issues that need adjustment
- If prerequisite work is needed: "We need [STORY-XX] first" or "New story needed for Y"

**Sprint-fit assessment** (mandatory):

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Estimated story points** | 1–5 SP (>5 → propose splitting) |
| **Sessions to done** | 1–2 sessions (>2 → too big, split) |
| **Sprint fit** | Does this story fit alongside the current sprint stories? (max 3–4 total) |
| **WIP impact** | Would adding this push WIP > 2? |
| **Carry-over risk** | Low / medium / high — based on complexity and dependencies |

On "high" carry-over risk, propose a split:
- Which parts can be carved out as separate stories?
- What is the minimal scope for a first pass?

**Wait for operator approval** before creating the Linear issue.

### Step 5b: Token heuristic + story points + execution mode (BOO-39)

Before pushing to Linear: estimate token usage and derive SP + mode. Convention: HANDBUCH Appendix G (BOO-38). Heuristic signals: `references/token-heuristik.md`.

**Logic:**

1. **Parse the story description** and extract signals:
   - Number of affected files (linear ~2k tokens per file)
   - Expected diff size in lines (~100 tokens per 50 lines)
   - Test effort (new tests +20–50% tool output)
   - Documentation effort (HANDBUCH, README, Excalidraw +10–30%)
   - Cross-skill touchpoints (+1k per skill)
   - Reference-file read overhead (+500–2000 per reference)

2. **Optional: L3 calibration** — if `journal/learnings.db` (level L3) exists: look up similar stories from recent sprints (same skills touched, similar diff size), adjust the multiplier. If L3 isn't there or fewer than 5 matches: unweighted heuristic.

3. **Compute the token estimate** as an absolute number plus percentage of the sprint budget (80% of the context window).

4. **Derive SP class from HANDBUCH Appendix G:**

   | Token estimate | Share of 80% budget | SP class | Execution mode |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | < 8k | ~5% | 1 | linear |
   | 8–24k | ~10–15% | 2 | linear / sub-agents |
   | 24–48k | ~20–30% | 3 | sub-agents |
   | 48–96k | ~40–60% | 5 | agentic |
   | > 96k | over 60% | 8 | **split the story** |

5. **Operator hybrid prompt:**

   ```
   "Token estimate: 38k (~24% sprint budget) → 3 SP → mode 'sub-agents'.
    Override? [y/n] (n = accept)"
   ```

   On `y`: new SP entry, mode is re-derived automatically from the table.

6. **Write the story-spec frontmatter:**

   ```yaml
   ---
   story_id: BOO-XX
   estimate: 3
   token_estimate: 38000
   execution_mode: sub-agents
   estimation_basis: |
     4 files (~8k), ~250 lines diff (~5k), test extension (+30%),
     HANDBOOK update (+20%), 2 similar stories in L3 (factor 0.9)
   ---
   ```

   `estimation_basis` is prose so the operator and later `/implement` step 0b can sanity-check the estimate.

7. **Set the Linear issue `estimate`.** Add the execution mode as a hint block in the issue body (Hermes reads it via the BOO-31 `metadata.hermes.related_skills`; other skills read it through the spec).

**On SP = 8 (story too large):** STOP. Operator instruction: split the story using the carry-over logic from Step 5. Continue to Step 6 only after the split.

### Step 6: Finalize (after OK)

1. Create the Linear issue with the full template
2. Update affected existing issues (dependencies, overall plan)
3. Summarize for the operator: what was created, what was changed
