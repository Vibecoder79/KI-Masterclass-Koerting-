# Backlog — Dependency-Aware Sprint Planning

> Loads the whole backlog, maps dependencies, honors DB schema chains, and proposes a concrete priority order. No more "which story next?" by gut feeling.

**Version:** 1.2.0 · **Command:** `/backlog`

---

## What It Does

Most backlogs are flat lists sorted by priority. Real backlogs have hidden structure: dependencies, schema version chains, and stories that Linear still shows as "Todo" even though they shipped last week.

This skill loads the whole picture — system context from `CLAUDE.md` + `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md`, completed issues from the last 30 days, all open issues — then builds a dependency graph. It catches things a human would miss:

- Stories that look blocked but aren't (blocker is already Done)
- Two stories both targeting `schemaVersion 18` (conflict — one must rewrite)
- Circular dependencies
- Orphaned references (`CLAW-14` mentioned in Issue X but doesn't exist)

---

## How It Works

```
Load system context  (CLAUDE.md + ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md + SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
        │
        ▼
Load completed issues (last 30 days)
        │
        ▼
Load open backlog (all statuses)
        │
        ▼
Dependency graph · Schema chain check · Cycle detection
        │
        ▼
Sort:  In Progress > Blockers > Priority > Dep-Depth > Age
        │
        ▼
Output:  Ordered list · Conflicts · Backlog hygiene suggestions
```

## The Schema-Chain Check (Mandatory)

Runs on every backlog pass. Stops schema conflicts before two engineers start the same migration:

1. Scan open issues for `## DB Schema Impact` sections
2. Build chain: `currentSchemaVersion → targetSchemaVersion` per story
3. Rule: **Stories with lower `targetSchemaVersion` always first**
4. Conflict flag: Two stories with the same target version → reported as **critical blocker**

Example output:
```
Schema Chain: STORY-A (v17 → v18) must ship before STORY-B (v18 → v19).
Conflict:     STORY-C and STORY-D both target v18 — one must be rewritten.
```

## Trigger Phrases

- `/backlog`
- "what's next?"
- "sprint planning"
- "priorities"
- "what should I pick up?"

## Interfaces with Other Skills

| Upstream | What's provided | Downstream | What we deliver |
|----------|-----------------|------------|------------------|
| `ideation` | New stories + dependencies + schema-impact | `implement` | The top-ranked story + reason why it comes first |
| Linear | Open / completed issues | `architecture-review` | Stories that need an architecture pre-check |
| `architecture-review` (System mode) | Recommended issues | `sprint-review` | Current backlog snapshot for quarterly audit |

---

## Artifacts / Outputs

- **Prioritized story list** with explicit reasoning per story
- **Dependency conflicts** — orphans, cycles, broken references
- **Schema chain report** — who goes before whom and why
- **Hygiene suggestions** — issues to close, re-priority, or split
